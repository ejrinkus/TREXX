What Does It Do?
----------------
This projects demonstrates the power of REXX as a character manipulation language and glue language.  Along with the REXX program is a text-adventure game written in Racket, and some Python scripts that can post an input message to social media.  Users need only to run the REXX program, and it will handle running the game and posting select messages regarding the players' experience in the game to social media.  REXX is used not only to parse and format output from the game, but also serves as a "glue" between the game and the scripts.
